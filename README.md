## My first project created with React! A Memory game with characters from one of my favorite shows ever: The Simpsons!

### How to play: 
* You can choose between **12, 18 or 24 cards**. Each group of cards contains a pair of matching cards for a character from The Simpsons (so, for example, a group of 12 cards have 6 characters). The characters are random in every new game and are not always the same (I think it is more fun not knowing which characters are going to appear in the next game!). 
* In each move, you can flip just two cards and see them for a second. Then automatically the cards flip back again, so you have to remember which characters are in those cards. **Your goal is to find all the pair matching cards**. 
* When you finish the game, a message informs you about how many moves you used and the elapsed time.
